# PowerShellAccessControl
Provides an easy way to view and modify security descriptors for most securable objects in Windows, including files, folders, registry keys, services, printers, shares, processes, and more.

This version of the module (version 3.0), isn't under active development anymore. Version 4.0 is a complete re-write of the module, and is currently available on the [TechNet Gallery] (https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/PowerShellAccessControl-d3be7b83). It will be on GitHub soon...
